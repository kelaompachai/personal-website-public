                Joe was a great asset to our team, both from a technical and non-technical perspective. Whether he was making quick and significant progress on his tasks or helping others make progress on theirs, Joe was always willing to help and go the extra mile. Joe provided valuable insight into solving problems and bugs and also communicated with others about solutions. Joe has been great to work with and I'm sure he will continue to be so for others.
