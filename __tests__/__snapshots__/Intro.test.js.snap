        Hi, I'm Joe Paul, a software engineer who's passionate about what's true. I enjoy building websites (front and back end), solving leetcode problems, reading classics, and hiking. I'm currently working on building a SQL database with an accompanying UI, learning AWS, and reading Eliot's Daniel Deronda. Feel free to email me if you'd like to talk about any of those things.
